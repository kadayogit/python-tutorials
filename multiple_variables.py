# Python allows you to assign values to multiple variables in one line:
x, y = "Guled", "Mohamed"

print(x)
print(y)

# One Value to Multiple Variables
# And you can assign the same value to multiple variables in one line:

b = n = z = "Multiple varibales has single value"
print(z)

# Unpack a Collection
# If you have a collection of values in a list, tuple etc. 
# Python allows you to extract the values into variables. 
# This is called unpacking.

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
x, y, z = fruits
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
